=head1 NAME

Date::Calendar::Hijri - Arithmetic variant of the Hijri calendar

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Converting a Gregorian date (e.g. 7th February 2021) into Hijri

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Date::Calendar::Hijri;
my Date $dt-greg;
my Date::Calendar::Hijri $dt-hijri;

$dt-greg  .= new(2021, 2, 7);
$dt-hijri .= new-from-date($dt-greg);

say $dt-hijri;
# --> 1442-06-24
say $dt-hijri.strftime("%A %d %B %Y");
# --> Yaum al-Ahad 24 Jumaada al-Thaani 1442

=end code

Converting a Hijri date (e.g. 1 Muharram 1443) into Gregorian

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Date::Calendar::Hijri;
my Date::Calendar::Hijri $dt-hijri;
my Date $dt-greg;

$dt-hijri .= new(year => 1443, month => 1, day => 1);
$dt-greg   = $dt-hijri->to-date;

say $dt-greg;
# --> 2021-08-10

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The real Hijri calendar is  an observational calendar. That means that
calendar events, such as switching from a month to the next, depend of
the observation  of some  astronomical events,  such as  observing the
moon crescent after a new moon.  But there is an unofficial arithmetic
variant, which differs from the real one by one or two days.

Date::Calendar::Hijri is a class  representing dates in the arithmetic
variant of the  Hijri calendar. It allows you to  convert a Hijri date
into Gregorian (or possibly other) calendar and the other way.


=head1 PROBLEMS AND KNOWN BUGS

As already stated, this module does not give the real Hijri dates, but
dates from a variant calendar  which follows closely, but imperfectly,
the Hijri calendar.

The  conversions are  valid before  sunset. It  is up  to the  user to
assert the  need of  incrementing the Hijri  date or  decrementing the
Gregorian date if the time of day is in the evening after sunset.
